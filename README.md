# Tic-Tac-Toe

### A Javascript project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The task was to use object-oriented programming to recreate the classic tic-tac-toe game.

I implemented the game logic through to main objects: a game board and a game controller.
This project was the first time I utilized CSS animations and keyframes, seen in the opacity fade-in as the page loads. 

The game is currently meant to be played between two people; at some point in the future I will revisit this project 
to implement an AI opponent. 

You can check it out on [my live GitHub page](https://socrastein.github.io/tic-tac-toe/).
